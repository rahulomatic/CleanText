# CleanText
A web-based application to blur out censored text/profanity. Especially useful when providing inspiring yet unparliamentary content/resources for educational purposes, and for censoring movie scripts and subtitles before submission or educational use.

In this first basic case, we provide some text that has no profanity. So it comes out as clean.

In this second case, some basic (harmless?) profanity has been provided for understanding. You can see how the words were [censored].

We can also upload the text directly if it it exists as a text file. We can also download the cleansed text as a text file too.
